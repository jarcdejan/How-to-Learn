## Intro

My name is Michael, I came with 20 years of experience and while I have a little bit of free time I like to mentor people. In this short document my goal is to tell you exactly how to learn, whatever you want to learn and rewrite whatever nonsense they've told you in schools. Let's begin!

## What to learn?
So, where to begin?

I bet that the first thing that you need to know is what you want to learn.

### Do you just want to get a job as soon as possible?
You should research what organisations need. Most of the time things don't change that fast. Reason for that is, that organisations really (whatever they say) don't like to invest billions in upgrading the skillsets of their existing employees. Also we normally have a lot of old systems and code. To refactor them every time a new framework or idea comes to market just wouldn't be financially viable.

So grab your LinkedIn account by the...ears (?) and do your research.

#### But what do I do after I know what I want to learn?
Visit [roadmaps.sh](https://roadmap.sh/roadmaps). Peak for instance "Frontend Developer" and go to town.

Click on everything and mark things that you know. After that get on read'n this article.

### I want to learn from the ground up

So, you learn by adding things to your understanding. That's great!

By learning C and after that C++, you will be on the fast lane to understand whatever other popular language.

#### But how to do that without dying of boredom?
Get an Arduino or RaspberryPi. If you want to learn just C++, buy an Arduino. If you want to learn a bit of LINUX on a way, buy RaspberryPi.

## How to learn?

People learn in different ways. I'm not really a specialist in this, but I can tell you how many geeks do it efficiently.

After you know what you want to learn, you need to break it down into really small chunks. For instance, if you want to learn how to bake an egg, learn first how much oil you need to throw on the pen. If your topic is covered by roadmap.sh, great - the big chunk of that task has been done for you. If it isn't, try to find a road-map or a great Youtube tutorial that will guide you step by step (normally it shouldn't be too old, not too long and you should have something to put on your github after you are finished).

So, after you know exactly what you need to learn next, go to Youtube, ask ChatGPT, Medium article or read documentation. Try to avoid Udemy and Lynda, since courses there are just too long. If you decide to go the Udemy route, look for courses that are popular and short. Don't buy massive courses. You will never finish them.

The final boss in getting better in learning should be an ability to learn directly from documentation. Learning that way is the fresshes kind of learning that you can get.


## What's next?

I hope that you've enjoyed this short article.

Next you should understand how you learn the fastest way possible. I've seen people that learn by reading, but I am more of the video and code examples kind of guy.

Getting to know yourself and your ability to learn will definitely pay you back big time in the future.

There is a word to be said on how much you can learn and what should be a final product.

Normal geek that is used to sitting in front of the computer for a whole day is capable of learning a maximum of about 3 hours a day imho. More than that and you are not efficiently absorbing the information that you get.

Final product should always be a project. That way you can put that on your CV and companies will love it.

A word of what companies are looking for, but I will go into this into another article.. Companies mostly look for people that know how to build products themself, know how to learn, do what they do from the heart and most of all: Will be able to make them profit ASAP.

Good luck!
